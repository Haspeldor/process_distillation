\chapter{Methodology}
% complete outline of the pipeline

\section{Data Gathering}
% real logs with protected attributes hard to come by

% 4 simulated log didn't show the necessary structure

\subsection*{Data Simulation}
% model/rule based transitions

\subsection*{Data Augmentation}
% rule based augmentation

\section{Data Processing}
% transformation into pandas dataframe?

% output: event classe

% input: should consist of last events and attributes

% fixed input - n_gram of last events

% attributes - one-hot/min-max encoded

\section{Training the Model}
% give model architecture

% discuss hyperparameters

% train test split

\section{Knowledge Distillation}
% transfer the knowledge from NN to DT

% predict all training labels

% use relabeled data as training data for decision tree

% explain hyperparameters

% image: process

\section{Modification of the Decision Tree}
% now visualized how the NN decides

% human inspector can decide whether usage of attributes is inappropriate

% when inappropriate node is found, what to do:

% image: comparative

\subsection*{Cutting Branches}
% exploitation of attribute not allowed, though rest distinctions ok

% choose most visited branch

% least effort

\subsection*{Retraining Subtrees}
% removing node might make subtrees invalid

% retrain starting from the node, while ignoring certain attributes

% more effort, might remove wanted bias in a subtree

\section{Finetuning of the Model}
% use modified DT to predict label for training data

% use this relabeled data to finetune the neural network

% explanation of methods

% explanation of hyperparameters

%image: process
