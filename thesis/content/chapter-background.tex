\chapter{Background}


\section{Predictive Business Process Monitoring}
% introduction to the task at hand process modeling

\subsection*{Process Modeling}
% basic intuition

% graphic notation

% img: example

\subsection*{Event Log Data}
% mathematical definition

% case attributes

\subsection*{Next Activity Prediction}
% mathematical definition


\section{Machine Learning Models}
% ML models are used as an oracle for predictions

\subsection*{Neural Networks}
% input/output data

% single perceptron as basis

% layering

% feed forward algorithm

% backwards propagation

% expressive, but black box

\subsection*{Decision Tree}
% describe input/output data

% consists of decision and output nodes

% classification algorithm

% training algorithm according to sklearn

% simple, so white box


\section{Fairness}
% decisions of ML models have effects in the real world

% important not to disadvantaged groups of people

% demographic parity

% threshold independent?
